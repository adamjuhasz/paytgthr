      <p>
        Using interviews and split data from over 200 couples we've designed a
        questionnaire to help you pick the best split for the two of you
      </p>
      <p>
        We'll ask you about 5 different ways you split common shared expenses
        and then give you a recommendation. If you want to give us yours and
        your partner's salary ranges we can then refine our recommendation
      </p>
