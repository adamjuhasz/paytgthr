    time they spend each day, week and month dealing with their joint expenses. 
    With the Tgthr Card, thereâ€™s no need for receipt saving, spreadsheet updating or Venmo requesting. 
    Simply swipe, split and be done. Oh yeah, and earn cash back rewards just for working
    Tgthr! Now, our customers can help their friends, family and 
    acquaintances feel the same stress relief they experience every day (and collect 
    some cash along the way)!"
